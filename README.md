# Sk-ST3 - Sk-VSC
A Modern, Colorful and Creative Syntax Highlighting for Skript Language on Sublime Text 3 and Visual Studio Code

**Note:** This Syntax Highlighting was based on @HYPExMon5ter's Syntax Highlighting but much more updated.


# Feel free to contribute and add your own/others themes and create a pull request

Adding your own theme to this syntax (Sublime Text 3 version) is pretty easy

1- Duplicate any theme from the syntax themes (.tmTheme) [located here](https://github.com/AyhamAl-Ali/Sk-ST3/tree/master/ST3/src)

2- Change the values of the colors from line **20** to line **31** to the values you like or from the other theme

```
<key>background</key>
<string>#263238</string>
<key>caret</key>
<string>#FFCC00</string>
<key>foreground</key>
<string>#588787</string>
<key>invisibles</key>
<string>#536D7982</string>
<key>lineHighlight</key>
<string>#1F292E</string>
<key>selection</key>
<string>#32464B</string>
```

3- Test it and make sure it works

Q: What will you provide in this Forked version?
A: I will be adding new syntax highlighting with new colors.

Q: Are you going to continue with this?
A: Probably, I do a lot of coding with Skript Language so I will keep this resource active as I can and add new syntaxes to it.

Q: Can we report issues and bugs or/and suggest new stuff on this resource?
A: Yes, you can use the issues section to report issues or/and suggest new syntax/colors.

Q: Why you made this?
A: I never liked coding without getting in the mood of coding, which requires some modern, [dark] themes and a nice syntax highlighting, I was lucky to find HYPExMon5ter's Syntax highlighting and I've used it for some time and then got a bit bored again.. so I decided to make my own forked version and learn the basics of Syntax Highlighting codes and Regex just so I can make this and use it.
